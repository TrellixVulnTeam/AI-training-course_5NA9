# AI Training Course 
This training course includes three major projects, which are related to different NN structures: DNN, CNN and RNN. Most of the projects are based on Python 3 and Tensorflow 1.0.
The following are the descriptions of each project:
## Project 1:
Based on Tensorflow, use DNN structure to classify the dataset.

#### [1] MNIST Task
This task is based on the tutorial: [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)
Add activation functions and several hidden layers to complete the DNN structure and improve the performance.

#### [2] CIFAR-10 Task
Based on the **MNIST Task**, use CIFAR-10 as the input dataset.
Try to increase the performance using different preprocessing methods, hyperparameters, or optimizers. 

## Project 2:
Based on Tensorflow, use CNN structure to classify the dataset.
